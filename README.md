# Kaggle Titanic Competition - Machine Learning Model

This repository contains my machine learning model for the Kaggle Titanic competition. The model predicts survival on the RMS Titanic based on various features of the passengers. This project demonstrates my approach to feature engineering, model selection, and ensemble techniques. The final submission achieved a score of 0.79665.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Predict survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques.
- **Data:** Utilized the Titanic dataset provided by Kaggle, including features like passenger class, sex, age, and fare.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new features like FamilySize, IsAlone, and Title. Applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables and imputation to handle missing values.
- **Model Selection:** Explored various machine learning models including RandomForest, LogisticRegression, KNeighbors, DecisionTree, GradientBoosting, XGBoost, and SVM.
- **Ensemble Technique:** Implemented a basic stacking approach with RandomForest, KNeighbors, and SVM as base learners and GradientBoosting as the meta-learner.
- **Evaluation:** Used cross-validation to evaluate model performance and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
- **Final Score:** Achieved a score of 0.79665 on the Kaggle leaderboard.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
